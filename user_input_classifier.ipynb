    "Being able to classify texts by philosophers is nice, but the useful part of this project would be classify text from users. We could, for example, examine tweets or other a user's posting history on any website to classify them as belonging to one school of though or another. This could then be used for sociological studies, marketing, or even just as a finger on the thumb of cultural shifts.\n",
